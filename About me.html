<h3> My hobby </h3>
<p> When I was five years old, I started learning piano. 
    On weekdays, I always ran to piano academy after school and spent after school playing the piano. 
    When I was in the second grade of elementary school, I went to the competition for the first time and won the grand prize.
    <br>Somehow, I prepared for the competition three years in a row, and as I received more and more good awards,
    I found it very interesting to prepare for the competition.
    The photos below are the results of three competitions. 
    I moved when I was in 5th grade, so I quit piano academy. 
    Therefore, I haven't been able to prepare for the competition since then. 
    Although I couldn't run toward my dream of becoming a pianist, these experiences are precious in that I can enjoy piano as a hobby now. </p>

<p> I started learning how to swim at the same time that I started learning the piano. 
    I loved going to the swimming pool because I usually really liked water. 
    Among swimming types, I liked breaststroke the most and was confident. 
    When I was a senior in elementary school, I won 3rd place in the local swimming competition. 
    I was an elementary school swimmer. Now that I think about it, it's a very valuable experience. 
    Even now, when I have time, I frequently go swimming pool. 
    When I swim, I don't have any trivial thoughts and I feel at ease.</p>

<h3> Sports activities </h3>
<p> I was a very active child. I wasn't afraid of failure, and I always tried to be active.
    I've tried swimming, surfing, snorkeling, tennis, longboarding, cruiserboarding, skiing, 
    ice skating, pilates, yoga, bicycles, inline skating and so on.

<h3> Part-time job experience </h3>

<h4 class="hyesoo"><img class"cena1" src="Gongcha.JPG" alt="Gongcha" style="width: 300px; height: 240px; margin-right: 15px;">
<img class"cena1" src="Dunkin.jpeg" alt="Dunkin" style="width: 300px; height:240px; margin-right: 15px;">

    <br>After graduating from high school, I worked 16.5 hours a week at <span class="class3"> Gongcha </span> for seven months. 
    <br>Gongcha had a variety of menus and people could customise the drink 
    so that making it is a little tricky for me. 
    <br>I was very busy because the store was one of the most profitable stores, 
    but the people I worked with were good people, <br>so I could work comfortably and enjoyably. 
</br><br>Seven months later, I quit my job for a while because of the university 
    and soon got to work for <span class="class4"> Dunkin Donuts </span> . 
    <br>In Dunkin, the drinks were all packed and all I had to do was mix them with water, 
    so I didn't have much work to do, <br>but it was rather too boring. 
    I think a hectic part-time job suits me better. 
    If I get a chance to work again, I want to work again in Gongcha.
