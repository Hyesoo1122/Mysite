    The reason why I chose <span class="class4"> Australia </span> as my favourite country was because 
    it was my first travel destination after I became an adult, 
    and people seemed to know how to relax and seemed free. 
    People ride skateboards, surf in the sea, lie on the beach and tanning. 
    It was a sight that could not be seen in our country. 
    For some reason, it was a country that made me feel at ease.
    Although the travel period was only two weeks, 
    I could feel that people were considerate and valued courtesy. 
    I miss my trip to Australia so much now.

            The reason why I chose <span class="class2"> Ron Pine Koala Sanctuary </span> as one of my favourite places is that 
            I could see kangaroos and koalas that I have always dreamed of. 
            Korean zoos have animals almost locked in bars or fences, but Australian zoos have not. 
            It was so shocking that there was a zoo that could run around with kangaroos and give them snacks. 
            Also, there was a koala hugging experience. 
            I was embarrassed because the koala was heavier than I thought, but I still feel vivid when I hug it.</p>

            <br><br>
            I experienced my first <span class="class1"> skydiving </span> in my life at Byron Bay in New South Wales, Australia. 
            There was not much fear of heights, so expectations were much higher than tensions.  
            The helicopter stopped at 15,000 feet and jumped against the backdrop of a great view. 
            The weather was so nice and the scenery was even better. 
            Behind me, the person who helped me took a video with a GoPro on his wrist. 
            Sometimes I watch the video and enjoy the feeling of that time. 
            When I go to Australia again, I want to try again.
            This place means a lot to my first skydiving challenge, and it's also a wonderful place.

            My favourite place and most memorable place for me is <span class="class3"> Bondi Beach </span>in Sydney.  
            The reason was that I could see the Iceberg swimming pool and the sea at a glance, 
            and for some reason, the watercolour of the Iceberg swimming pool was emerald which is so beautiful colour. 
            The colours of the pool and the sea are similar but different, so the more beautiful picture is flushed. 
            We could get waves in the Iceberg swimming pool and it was a special attraction that only the pool had. 
            Also, I learned how to surf at Bondi Beach. It was hard, but it was very special and fun for me. 
            I couldn't try surfing in my country because I was afraid it would ruin the image of Bondi Beach in my head.  
            It is a place where I had a special experience, so I think it is more memorable.</p>
