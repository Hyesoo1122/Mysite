<h3> Character [Eeyore] </h3>

<div class="row1">
    <div class="column2">
       <img src ="Eeyore.gif" alt="Eeyore" style=" width: 450px; height:380px; margin-right:0px;">

        <p> <br><br>
            My favourite character is <span class ="class6"> Eeyore </span>.
            Eeyore is a donkey in Winnie the Pooh. 
            When I was six years old, my father bought me this character pillow for Christmas present. 
            From then on, I started to have an affection for the character Eeyore, 
            and I really like it until now. When I see the products made of Eeyore, 
            I always buy them and collect, so there are about 20 items related to Eeyore.
            Eeyore is always a gloomy and silent character. 
            When I watch the pooh movie, I want to comfort and help him. 
            Maybe that's why I'm more attached to it, although it's not a real animal.

    This <span class ="class7"> Eeyore </span> is my most treasured doll. 
    The person who I cherish gave me as a present. 
    <br>When I see this, It reminds me of the day I received this and memory with that person. 
    <br>I always hug this cushion tightly when I sleep, 
    and it's big and soft, so I feel good when I sleep with it.

<li><h4> Film Camera </h4></li>
     
     <p> <img class="cena1" src ="Film Camera.JPG" alt="Film camera" style=" width: 280px; height:280px; margin-right:20px;">
        <br><br><br>
        I like taking pictures and taking pictures. 
        Turn on the camera and record wherever I want to remember. 
        I always took pictures with my cell phone camera, but one day I found out that there was a film camera. 
        If I take a picture with a film camera, the picture is not saved to the camera, 
        so only one film that comes out immediately after the shooting becomes a memory. 
        So there are some people who think negatively about film cameras. However, I thought there was a different 
        feeling from the filter that looked at the film. I really care about this <span class ="class8"> film camera </span>. 
        I make many memories with this camera when I go out with my friends or when I have an important appointment.
        I want to make more memories with this camera, as I have done so far.
